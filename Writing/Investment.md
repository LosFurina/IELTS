# Investment on education for government.

## Title
Instead of asking the government to bear the cost of higher education, students should pay tuition fees themselves. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

## Practice

With the increasing population, there will be more and more students need to be educated, which means the goveronment shoud take heavier stress on expense of school. Hence, someone argues that the tuition should be taken by themselves. In my opinion, we are supposed to face this issue dialectically.

The main reason for supporting that goveronment should pay the education fee focus on two points. Firstly, it is undeniable that the goveronment should take the responsibility of educational expense since local people have paid the tax on education, there is no any reasons for goveronment to require tax-payer pay another extra fee. Secondly, if goveronment implement this policy, some people may lose the chance of education, because the high fare of education is not affordable for all of people. In conclusion, there will be more young people lack of knowledge and skills, which will cause more unemployment.

On the other hand, it is also reasonable that some people agree the opposite viewpoint. First and foremost, have individuals pay part of their tuition, rather than covering all costs by government, can enhance the quality of education, because with more accessible funding of education, schools can employ more teachers with high qualification and purchase more education facilities, which helps students learn more efficiently. Besides, this policy will also improve the level public welfare since government have more funds abaviable for other important areas such as public healthcare, infrastructure and environmental management.

In the light of thses facts, we should acknowledge that both sides have their own advantages to accept, but it is unavoidable that paying additional tuition will increase the stress for individuals. And yet, there are some inherent benefits to personally financing education. Therefore, we should accept both points with caution.

题目: Instead of asking the government to bear the cost of higher education, students should pay tuition fees themselves. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

引言: With the increasing number of students seeking higher education, the debate on who should bear the cost of education has become more pressing. Some argue that students should pay for their tuition themselves rather than relying on government funding. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe a balanced approach is essential.

正方观点: Firstly, it is reasonable to argue that the government should cover the cost of education since taxpayers already contribute to public funds. Asking them to pay additional fees would seem unfair. Additionally, if education costs are solely borne by students, many may be deprived of higher education opportunities due to financial constraints, potentially leading to a less educated workforce and higher unemployment rates.

反方观点: Conversely, having students contribute to their tuition can enhance the quality of education. With additional funding from students, schools can hire qualified teachers and improve facilities, leading to a better learning environment. Moreover, if the government allocates fewer resources to education, it can invest in other critical areas like healthcare, infrastructure, and environmental protection, thus benefiting society as a whole.

结论: In conclusion, while there are merits to both perspectives, it is crucial to find a middle ground. Students contributing to tuition could improve educational quality and allow the government to focus on other essential sectors. However, ensuring that education remains accessible to all is equally important. A nuanced approach that balances student contributions with government support might be the most effective solution.
