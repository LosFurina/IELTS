# Imported Products

## Practice

**In some countries, it is now possible for people to buy products made in other countries. To what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problems?**

With the development of transportation, it is becoming more and more convenient for people to purchase some stuffs produced overseas, which is an unstopped trend for globalization. From the personal view, the advantages of this phenomenon overweight the disadvantages.

The main reason for supporting buying products from overseas are focusing on two points. Firstly, the people could purchase some stuffs cheaper if they choose those from overseas. Since different countries or regions own the different technics and resources uniquely, so they could manufacture those products with less extra expense like transportation fee and knowledge fee. For that,  the final producing cost could be much less than other countries. For instance, with the advantages of location of Southeast Asia, the agriculture of tropical fruits is developed, the fruit from there are less expensive with high qualification.  On the other hand, for some products, oversea market offers more choices for people to select. Therefore, people could purchase the different kind of it by following their own prefer. Taking the smartphone as an example, people may prefer different brands, for those who enjoy the tidy of operation system could buy iPhone, those who are the fans of photography could choose Sony.

In contrast, that is not a good news for domestic industrial. It is undeniable that some oversea products bring the convenience and cheap price for people, but it also will have impact on same type domestic industrials, they have to face the challenge from foreign companies, which means some people have to face the risks of unemployment. Besides, it is also inevitable that buying products from overseas could cause more global transports, furtherly leading to the more pollution of environment, which will degrade the air condition and so on.

It is there reasonable to reckon that we are supposed to accept those importing products with caution. Although the people could receive some benefit from oversea products,  it is also necessary to develop the native industrials.
