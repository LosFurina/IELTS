**Societies benefit from international tourism and business. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

With globalization and the advancement of transportation, it has become increasingly convenient for people to travel across the globe. In this context, it is inevitable that societies can reap significant benefits from flourishing tourism. However, the substantial drawbacks associated with developing tourism should not be overlooked.

The impact of tourism on some countries is twofold. First and foremost, tourism is widely regarded as a powerful driver for economic growth. It directly boosts the local economy by creating job opportunities in tourism-related sectors and generating revenue from foreign tourists, which can lead to an improved standard of living and increased wealth for local residents. Additionally, the flourishing of tourism often stimulates the development of related industries such as food, hospitality, and transportation. Without the driving force of tourism, many of these businesses might struggle to survive in a competitive market.

On the other hand, while the economic benefits of tourism are undeniable, there are also significant risks to consider. One major concern is environmental degradation. The influx of tourists can lead to increased waste production, making waste management a growing challenge for local governments. If not properly managed, this can result in further environmental issues, including air and water pollution, which can have long-term detrimental effects on both the ecosystem and public health.

In light of these facts, although tourism can help some countries generate more revenue and improve the quality of life for local citizens, it is also inevitable that tourism can cause environmental challenges. Therefore, countries that develop tourism should carefully balance its benefits and drawbacks to ensure sustainable development.
