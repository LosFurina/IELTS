# English

**English has become a universal language. Do you think that the positive effects of this trend outweigh negative effects?**

## Practice

It is well known that the most wild-used language across the world is English duo to some historical and practical factors. Someone may argue that this is not a good phenomenon, but from my perspective, the advantages of using English wildly are still overweigh the disadvantages.

The main reasons for supporting the generalization of English focus on two points. First and foremost, English can stimulate the boosting of economy of the countries since people are able to have conversation with foreign traders all around the world with the same English. For example, if a company's financial statement is written in English, any investors from diffenet countries can understand it through English. Secondly, English is a driving force for international cooperation. According to statistic, approximate 80% information on internet is written in English such as google, twitter and any other famous websit are mainly uesd in Engish due to the convenience of English. Besides, as we all know, the most internation conferences and orgnaiszation recognize the English as the official language to record their document. In the light the these facts, people can overcome the challenges of diffence from different culture to communicate and cooperate well.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that there are some detrimental effects on saving the varieties of local culture. With the thriving of using English as a general tool to communication, more and more young peopl may overlook that the culture of theirs is losing. For instance, some countries are implementing the policies of encourging students to learn more English to achieve globalization but neglect the learling of local languge, which absolutely will cause the culture losing.

Based on the factors above, while there are plently of benefits from using supporting generalization of English, we should not ignort those negative effects from influx of using Englihsh. Overall, the advantages still overweigh the disadvantages, but we should face the issues from English in caution.
